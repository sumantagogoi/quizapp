Monserrate remarked that 'the king cared little that in allowing \neveryone to follow his religion he was in reality violating all'. Akbar was curious about Christianity and \ndispatched an embassy to Goa to invite Jesuit Priests. The first Jesuit mission reached the Mughal \ncourt at Fatehpur Sikri in 1580 and St. Jesuit stayed for about two years. The Jesuits spoke to Akbar \nabout Christianity and debated its virtues with the ulama. Two more missions were sent to the Mughal \ncourt at Lahore, in 1591 and 1595."

It is \nwidely regarded as the place where Gandhi made his first experiments in Satyagraha and then \nreplicated them elsewhere. During British rule, many tenant farmers were forced to growindigo on \npart of their land, often working under oppressive conditions. This indigo was used to make dye. But \nthe demand for indigo dropped when the Germans invented a cheaper artificial dye. However, during\nthe First World War, the German dye ceased to be available and indigo once more became profitable \nfor the British. Many tenants were forced again into indigo cultivation - required by their lease under \nBritish law. This led to anger and resentment among the tenants, with several alleging that the \nlandlords were using strong- arm tactics. A farmer named Raj Kumar Shukla appealed to Gandhiji to \norganize the struggle to save the plantation workers. Shukla's persuasion paid off and Gandhi visited \nthe district in April 1917 and Satyagraha started. The main objective of the Satyagraha was to create \nawakening among the peasants against the European planters."

However, you may have noticed that not all families are identical: \nthey vary in terms of numbers of members, their relationship with one another as well as the kinds of \nactivities they share. Often people belonging to the same family share food and other resources, and \nlive, work and perform rituals together. Families are usually parts of larger networks of people defined \nas relatives, or to use a more technical term, kinfolk. While familial ties are often regarded as 'natural' \nand based on blood, they are defined in many different ways. For instance, some societies regard \ncousins as being blood relations, whereas others do not."
